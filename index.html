<h1>Some Special Information</h1>

<ul>

<li>How often have you been made to feel guilty about indulging your sweet tooth for “no apparent reason” by the health freaks around you? Endless lectures on how dessert should be eaten in moderation or not at all seem to echo in our ears every time we’re spotted nibbling on our favorite sweetmeats.</li>    
<li>While we don’t really need a reason to eat desserts, there are some who wonder in amazement why we’re being kind to ourselves ever so frequently without a proper reason. For connoisseurs of desserts, however, it doesn’t matter what the occasion or the time of the year it is. Rather, it is all about feeding the soul with food that makes them feel like they’ve finally found Heaven on earth.</li>    
<li>If you’re one of those “healthy” people who crave chocolates, smores, and strawberry shortcakes, but feel guilty at the mere confession of the cravings, we’ve got some good news for you.
Eating dessert does not mean you have little or no self-control. It only means that you have a good sense of what you want (sometimes it is just a sinful blueberry cheesecake), and that you have what it takes to honor these cravings.</li>
